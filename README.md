# Personal Website

Welcome to my [personal website](https://cty20010831.github.io/personal_site/)! This is an [MIT licensed](https://github.com/mldangelo/personal-site/blob/main/LICENSE) React-based Jamstack application. It offers a simple interface, easy modifications, static export capabilities, and free automatic deployments via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## 🚀 Features

- Built with modern JavaScript, using tools and frameworks like [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), [React-Router](https://reactrouter.com/), and SCSS.
- Automated workflows via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).
- And more!

## 🔧 Dependencies

Ensure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/) >= v16. Optionally, use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) to manage node versions.

## 🚀 Setup and Running

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone git://github.com/mldangelo/personal-site.git
   cd personal-site
   ```

2. (Optional) Ensure you're on Node v16 or higher:

   ```bash
   # Install nvm (make sure to fetch the latest version)
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash

   # Install Node.js
   nvm install
   node --version
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

By default, the application should be available at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

## 🚢 Deploying
Here, I added lines under `package.json` to directly deploy using gh-pages without needing to using github workfow (`.github/workflows/github-pages/yml` deleted).

Now, to update changes and deploy it to my personal website, simply run:
```bash
npm run build

npm run deploy
```

This [website](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages) provides useful information on how to deploy the webpage to CDN.
