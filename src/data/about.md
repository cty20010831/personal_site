# Intro

I am currently working as a full-time research assistant at <a href="https://www.digitalpsych.org/" target="_blank">John Torous' lab</a> in the Department of Psychiatry at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (an affiliated hospital of Harvard Medical School). I recevied my bachelor's degree in Applied Psychology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen in 2023 (under the supervision of <a href="https://hss.cuhk.edu.cn/en/teacher/470" target="_blank">Dr. Shi Yu</a>) and my master's degree in Computational Social Science at the University of Chicago in 2025 (under the supervision of <a href="https://psychology.uchicago.edu/directory/Akram-Bakkour" target="_blank"> Dr. Akram Bakkour</a>).  

Broadly speaking, I am interested in developing more naturalistic, multi-modal approaches to psychiatry. With the advances in real-time measurement technologies and AI-driven analytical methods, my research aims to introduce naturalistic cognitive neuroscience paradigms (e.g., naturalistic stimuli, VR-enhanced paradigms) to study the computational mechanmisms human high-level cognition (e.g., decision-making, inhibitory control, and cognitive flexibility) and understand how they fall apart in mental disorders. I am also interested in pairing ubiquitous sensors with cognitive neuroscience techniques to gain a better understanding of brain-body-behavior signal dynamics in psychiatric disorders, leveraging state-of-the-art digital phenotyping techniques from signal processing to time-series analysis to multimodal fusion. Together, my research aims to bridge theory-driven and data-driven approaches of psychiatry to bridge the gap between theoretical insights and practical clinical applications, empowering clinicians with tools for dynamic diagnostics and personalized treatment strategies.

# Fun Facts

- My Chinese name is 丛天越, and it carries a special meaning in Chinese. My family name, 丛, is pronounced the same as 从, which essentially means "from" in English. My given name, 天越, can be broken down into 天 ("sky") and 越 ("to cross" or "overcome"). Together, my name can be interpreted as "crossing or overcoming (any obstacle) through the sky." Shout out to my dad for giving me this name—I think it's pretty cool 😎!
- I am good at forming mental maps that guide spacial navigation in daily life 🗺️⁀જ✈︎. 
- I recognize faces more easily than names ᕙ(  •̀ ᗜ •́  )ᕗ. 
- I used to play soccer in elementary school before switching to basketball after becoming a fan of the U.S. basketball team during the 2008 Beijing Olympics 🏆.
- I am the first in my family that studies abroad 🎓.
- I adopted a cute cat 🐱 called Burrata (yes, say cheese ✌️) in January 2025. 

# Travel / Geography

- I was born and raised in **Shanghai**, China, a city I deeply cherish for its unique blend of tradition and modernity. From its vibrant culture to its mouth-watering cuisine—like Xiaolongbao (小笼包), Palmier (蝴蝶酥), and Braised Pork Belly (红烧肉)—Shanghai has always held a special place in my heart.
- I pursued my undergraduate studies in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province. During those four years, I developed a deep appreciation for **Cantonese culture**. I found the sound of Cantonese beautiful, with its rhythmic tones and pronunciation enhancing the appeal of Cantonese music. I also fell in love with the incredible Cantonese cuisine, such as home-made dim sum (粤式点心), Steamed Vermicelli Roll (肠粉), Sizzling Chicken Casserole (啫啫煲). 
- I have been to approximately 40 cities in China. Among them, Guangzhou, Quanzhou, and Suzhou (yes, they all end with *zhou*, roughly meaning "county" in English) are my favorites ⭐.   
- One of my biggest regrets is that I haven't yet visited provinces renowned for their natural landscapes 🏞️, such as Tibet, Xinjiang, and Gansu.
- Before pursuing my master’s degree in the U.S., I visited once during high school for a Model United Nations conference. It feels like fate that I had the opportunity to study in **Chicago** 🌇—the city I fell in love with back then for its impressive skyscrapers and clean streets.
- After exploring both the west and east coasts of America, I've grown fond of many places: the sunshine of California, the breathtaking views of Bryce Canyon and Zion National Park, and the cozy charm of Providence, Rhode Island.
- Some of the top countries on my travel wishlist include Singapore, England, Germany, and Argentina. 

# I Dream Of
