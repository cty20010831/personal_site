# Intro

I am currently working as a full-time research assistant at <a href="https://www.digitalpsych.org/" target="_blank">John Torous' lab</a> in the Department of Psychiatry at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC). I recevied my bachelor's degree in Applied Psychology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen in 2023 (under the supervision of <a href="https://hss.cuhk.edu.cn/en/teacher/470" target="_blank">Dr. Shi Yu</a>) and my master's degree in Computational Social Science at the University of Chicago in 2025 (under the supervision of <a href="https://psychology.uchicago.edu/directory/Akram-Bakkour" target="_blank"> Dr. Akram Bakkour</a>).  

Broadly, my research bridges theory-driven and data-driven approaches to improve the clinical relevance of computational psychiatry. I study how cognitive and affective dysfunctions manifest in naturalistic settings, focusing on decision-making, spontaneous thought dynamics, and anticipatory anxiety using ecologically valid tasks, fMRI, and computational modeling. On the data-driven side, I integrate multimodal behavioral, neurophysiological, and digital data streams—captured via smartphones, wearables, and experience sampling—to build interpretable, personalized models of mental health. Through these multimodel data fusion models, I aim to bridge the gap between theoretical insights and practical clinical applications, empowering clinicians with tools for dynamic diagnostics and personalized treatment strategies.

# Fun Facts

- My Chinese name is 丛天越, and it carries a special meaning in Chinese. My family name, 丛, is pronounced the same as 从, which essentially means "from" in English. My given name, 天越, can be broken down into 天 ("sky") and 越 ("to cross" or "overcome"). Together, my name can be interpreted as "crossing or overcoming (any obstacle) through the sky." Shout out to my dad for giving me this name—I think it's pretty cool 😎!
- I am good at forming mental maps that guide spacial navigation in daily life 🗺️⁀જ✈︎. 
- I recognize faces more easily than names ᕙ(  •̀ ᗜ •́  )ᕗ. 
- I used to play soccer in elementary school before switching to basketball after becoming a fan of the U.S. basketball team during the 2008 Beijing Olympics 🏆.
- I am the first in my family that studies abroad 🎓.

# Travel / Geography

- I was born and raised in **Shanghai**, China, a city I deeply cherish for its unique blend of tradition and modernity. From its vibrant culture to its mouth-watering cuisine—like Xiaolongbao (小笼包), Palmier (蝴蝶酥), and Braised Pork Belly (红烧肉)—Shanghai has always held a special place in my heart.
- I pursued my undergraduate studies in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province. During those four years, I developed a deep appreciation for **Cantonese culture**. I particularly found the sound of Cantonese beautiful, with its rhythmic tones and pronunciation enhancing the appeal of Cantonese music. I also fell in love with the incredible Cantonese cuisine, such as home-made dim sum (粤式点心), Steamed Vermicelli Roll (肠粉), Sizzling Chicken Casserole (啫啫煲). 
- I have been to approximately 40 cities in China. Among them, Guangzhou, Quanzhou, and Suzhou (yes, they all end with *zhou*, roughly meaning "county" in English) are my favorites ⭐.   
- One of my biggest regrets is that I haven't yet visited provinces renowned for their natural landscapes 🏞️, such as Tibet, Xinjiang, and Gansu.
- Before pursuing my master’s degree in the U.S., I visited once during high school for a Model United Nations conference. It feels like fate that I now have the opportunity to study in **Chicago** 🌇—the city I fell in love with back then for its impressive skyscrapers and clean streets.
- After exploring both the west and east coasts of America, I've grown fond of many places: the sunshine of California, the breathtaking views of Bryce Canyon and Zion National Park, and the cozy charm of Providence, Rhode Island.
- Aside from my travels to the U.S., I’ve had the chance to visit two other countries. My first trip was to **Switzerland**, where I was captivated by the breathtaking views of the Alps ⛰️— and I must say, the cheese fondue 🧀 was incredible! My second trip took me to **Japan**, where I finally tasted authentic ramen 🍜, a long-awaited culinary delight.
- Some of the top countries on my travel wishlist include Singapore, England, Spain, and Argentina.
