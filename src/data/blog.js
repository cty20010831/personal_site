    content: `Although this is only two one-day visit for connecting flights, I experienced the huge difference in commodity price between the US and UAE.
              Here at UAE, you can enjoy probably better car rental and hotel services at only half the price in America. 
              A reasonable next step is probably finding a connecting flight in Doha when I travel between the east coast and Chinaü§≠.`,

    excerpt: 'The moment of pride and gratitude.',
    content: `Two years at the University of Chicago passed by so fast.
              I am grateful to make friends with so many open-minded people.
              I am also blessed to join Dr. Akram Bakkour's lab to become a better researcher. 
              Although the grad school application did not come out as expected, my time at UChicago will always be a piece of precious memory.`,

    excerpt: 'An incredible journey through America\'s first national park, capturing stunning landscapes and wildlife moments.',
    content: `A wonderful trip to probably the most renowned national park in the US.
              I have to say that this is the BEST national park I have ever been to.
              The scenery is breathtaking, the wildlife is abundant, and the people there are friendly.
              We were quite fortunate that there weren't many tourists in late May, which makes the overall experience so much better.
              I also get a chance to rent a pick-up truck (a RAM 1500)!!! Oh boy, I have to say it is such a comfortable vehicle to try in places other than populated cities.
              I would highly recommend this trip to anyone who is looking for a great national park experienceüëç.`,

    excerpt: 'A wonderful trip to the most famous city in the world.',
    content: `This trip carries two meanings for me.
              First, this is the first time I make a poster presentation at a conference (in this case, Society of Neuroscience for Creativity). 
              This poster presentation is related to my master thesis at UChicago and I learned a lot by getting a sense of the latest directions in creativity reseach. 
              Second, I spent around two days wandering through the city streets of probably one of the most beautiful city in the world, and enjoying the delicious food.
              On the record, the yummy French cuisine is cheaper than what I had back in China!`,
