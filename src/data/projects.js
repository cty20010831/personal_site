      'This project explores the intricate relationship between mood states and creativity, specifically focusing on how mood activation levels such as happiness and calmness influence creative outputs. By employing advanced deep learning techniques, experimental tasks like the incompleteness drawing task, and narrative analysis methods like Divergent Semantic Integration (DSI), this study aims to quantitatively dissect the creative process into measurable aspects of flexibility and originality.',

      'This published paper investigates the relationship between academic stress and sleep quality among Chinese college students, focusing on both mediating factors such as social comparison and bedtime procrastination and the moderating factor of emotion regulation strategies. We also developed the Perceived Academic Stress Scale for Chinese Undergraduate Students (PASSCUS), which distinguishes between stress from long-term educational pressures (involution) and short-term academic workload.',
