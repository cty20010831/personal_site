# Intro

I am a second-year UChicago MACSS student interested in <b style="color:#FF6347;">cognitive modeling</b> 🧠 to better understand mental processes among individuals with and without mental disorders. Broadly, I am interested in studying cognitive processes behind human <b style="color:#FF6347;">creativity</b> ✨ using state-of-the-art computational approaches (e.g., compositional stroke embedding models for drawing and NLP for narratives). Additionally, I am interested in utilizing reinforcement learning and sequential sampling models, as well as novel AI-based methods to better understand people's <b style="color:#FF6347;">decision-making processes</b> ⚖️ and further to advance <b style="color:#FF6347;">diagnostic and therapeutic methodologies</b> 🩺 through rigorous, data-driven approaches that extend beyond traditional psychological assessments.

# Fun Facts

- My Chinese name is 丛天越, and it carries a special meaning in Chinese. My family name, 丛, is pronounced the same as 从, which essentially means "from" in English. My given name, 天越, can be broken down into 天 ("sky") and 越 ("to cross" or "overcome"). Together, my name can be interpreted as "crossing or overcoming (any obstacle) through the sky." Shout out to my dad for giving me this name—I think it's pretty cool 😎!
- I am good at forming mental maps that guide spacial navigation in daily life 🗺️⁀જ✈︎. 
- I recognize faces more easily than names ᕙ(  •̀ ᗜ •́  )ᕗ. 
- I used to play soccer in elementary school before switching to basketball after becoming a fan of the U.S. basketball team during the 2008 Beijing Olympics 🏆.
- I am the first in my family that studies abroad 🎓.

# Travel / Geography

- I was born and raised in **Shanghai**, China, a city I deeply cherish for its unique blend of tradition and modernity. From its vibrant culture to its mouth-watering cuisine—like Xiaolongbao (小笼包), Palmier (蝴蝶酥), and Braised Pork Belly (红烧肉)—Shanghai has always held a special place in my heart.
- I pursued my undergraduate studies in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province. During those four years, I developed a deep appreciation for **Cantonese culture**. I particularly found the sound of Cantonese beautiful, with its rhythmic tones and pronunciation enhancing the appeal of Cantonese music. I also fell in love with the incredible Cantonese cuisine, such as home-made dim sum (粤式点心), Steamed Vermicelli Roll (肠粉), Sizzling Chicken Casserole (啫啫煲). 
- I have been to approximately 40 cities in China. Among them, Guangzhou, Quanzhou, and Suzhou (yes, they all end with *zhou*, roughly meaning "county" in English) are my favorites ⭐.   
- One of my biggest regrets is that I haven't yet visited provinces renowned for their natural landscapes 🏞️, such as Tibet, Xinjiang, and Gansu.
- Before pursuing my master’s degree in the U.S., I visited once during high school for a Model United Nations conference. It feels like fate that I now have the opportunity to study in **Chicago** 🌇—the city I fell in love with back then for its impressive skyscrapers and clean streets.
- After exploring both the west and east coasts of America, I've grown fond of many places: the sunshine of California, the breathtaking views of Bryce Canyon and Zion National Park, and the cozy charm of Providence, Rhode Island.
- Aside from my travels to the U.S., I’ve had the chance to visit two other countries. My first trip was to **Switzerland**, where I was captivated by the breathtaking views of the Alps ⛰️— and I must say, the cheese fondue 🧀 was incredible! My second trip took me to **Japan**, where I finally tasted authentic ramen 🍜, a long-awaited culinary delight.
- Some of the top countries on my travel wishlist include Singapore, England, Spain, and Argentina.
