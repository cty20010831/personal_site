# Intro

I am a second-year student in the MACSS program at the University of Chicago, passionate about using <b style="color:#FF6347;">cognitive modeling</b> 🧠 to better understand mental processes in individuals with and without mental disorders. My research focuses on developing multi-modal, real-world frameworks in computational psychiatry that integrate diverse data streams—such as real-time inputs from wearables, smartphones, and behavioral monitoring—to continuously track mental and cognitive changes across different timescales. Through these models, I aim to bridge the gap between theoretical insights and practical clinical applications, empowering clinicians with tools for dynamic diagnostics and personalized treatment strategies.

In parallel, I explore <b style="color:#FF6347;">people's decision-making processes</b> ⚖️ by incorporating reinforcement learning and sequential sampling models. This line of research seeks to develop AI-powered <b style="color:#FF6347;">diagnostic and therapeutic methodologies</b> 🩺, advancing mental health care beyond traditional psychological assessments.

Additionally, I study <b style="color:#FF6347;"> human creativity</b> ✨ by building cognitive models such as compositional stroke embedding for drawing and NLP-based methods for narrative analysis. This work helps uncover the underlying cognitive processes behind creative expression, which, in turn, offers new perspectives on mental health and well-being.

By connecting these threads, my goal is to develop comprehensive frameworks that advance both the understanding of cognition and the practical delivery of mental health care, combining insights from creativity, decision-making, and psychiatric modeling into meaningful, real-world applications.

# Fun Facts

- My Chinese name is 丛天越, and it carries a special meaning in Chinese. My family name, 丛, is pronounced the same as 从, which essentially means "from" in English. My given name, 天越, can be broken down into 天 ("sky") and 越 ("to cross" or "overcome"). Together, my name can be interpreted as "crossing or overcoming (any obstacle) through the sky." Shout out to my dad for giving me this name—I think it's pretty cool 😎!
- I am good at forming mental maps that guide spacial navigation in daily life 🗺️⁀જ✈︎. 
- I recognize faces more easily than names ᕙ(  •̀ ᗜ •́  )ᕗ. 
- I used to play soccer in elementary school before switching to basketball after becoming a fan of the U.S. basketball team during the 2008 Beijing Olympics 🏆.
- I am the first in my family that studies abroad 🎓.

# Travel / Geography

- I was born and raised in **Shanghai**, China, a city I deeply cherish for its unique blend of tradition and modernity. From its vibrant culture to its mouth-watering cuisine—like Xiaolongbao (小笼包), Palmier (蝴蝶酥), and Braised Pork Belly (红烧肉)—Shanghai has always held a special place in my heart.
- I pursued my undergraduate studies in Shenzhen, Guangdong Province. During those four years, I developed a deep appreciation for **Cantonese culture**. I particularly found the sound of Cantonese beautiful, with its rhythmic tones and pronunciation enhancing the appeal of Cantonese music. I also fell in love with the incredible Cantonese cuisine, such as home-made dim sum (粤式点心), Steamed Vermicelli Roll (肠粉), Sizzling Chicken Casserole (啫啫煲). 
- I have been to approximately 40 cities in China. Among them, Guangzhou, Quanzhou, and Suzhou (yes, they all end with *zhou*, roughly meaning "county" in English) are my favorites ⭐.   
- One of my biggest regrets is that I haven't yet visited provinces renowned for their natural landscapes 🏞️, such as Tibet, Xinjiang, and Gansu.
- Before pursuing my master’s degree in the U.S., I visited once during high school for a Model United Nations conference. It feels like fate that I now have the opportunity to study in **Chicago** 🌇—the city I fell in love with back then for its impressive skyscrapers and clean streets.
- After exploring both the west and east coasts of America, I've grown fond of many places: the sunshine of California, the breathtaking views of Bryce Canyon and Zion National Park, and the cozy charm of Providence, Rhode Island.
- Aside from my travels to the U.S., I’ve had the chance to visit two other countries. My first trip was to **Switzerland**, where I was captivated by the breathtaking views of the Alps ⛰️— and I must say, the cheese fondue 🧀 was incredible! My second trip took me to **Japan**, where I finally tasted authentic ramen 🍜, a long-awaited culinary delight.
- Some of the top countries on my travel wishlist include Singapore, England, Spain, and Argentina.
